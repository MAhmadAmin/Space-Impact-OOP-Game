# Space Impact â€“ OOP Game Project

This project is a final-term **OOP Game Project** submission by **Muhammad Ahmad Amin** for the **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)** course *(2nd semester, BS Computer Science)*, instructed by **Prof. Awais Hassan** at **UET (University of Engineering & Technology) Lahore**.

The same game was initially developed using **C++ procedural programming** during the **Programming Fundamentals (PF)** course *(1st semester, BS Computer Science)*. It has now been **redeveloped using C# and object-oriented principles** as part of this course.

You can find the C++ procedurally Programmed code on my profile [@Muhammad Ahmad Amin](https://github.com/MAhmadAmin)



## Learning Objective

**Space Impact** is a console-based space shooter game, heavily inspired by the legendary game found on classic Nokia 1100 phones. The project focuses on applying core **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts like:

- Classes & Objects  
- Inheritance  
- Polymorphism  
- Abstraction  
- Encapsulation
- SOLID Principle


## Technologies Used

- **Language:** C#  
- **Platform:** Console Application  
- **Framework:** .NET (Desktop)  
- **Paradigm:** Object Oriented Programming


## Game Concept

The galaxy is under attack, and only you can save the **Milky Way**!  
You must pilot your spaceship through **3 challenging levels**, battling **4 different enemies**, including the **final mastermind boss**.

Survive all levels, defeat the mastermind, and restore peace to the stars.



## Features

- Smooth console-based gameplay  
- Player spaceship with movement and shooting mechanics  
- Multiple enemy types with different behaviors  
- Progressive difficulty across levels  
- Boss fight with unique patterns  
- Clear OOP structure and modular codebase
